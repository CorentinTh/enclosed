# Versioning

The Enclosed project follows the [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) specification. This means that the version number is incremented following the following format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

Starting from version `1.5.0`, all the packages of the Enclosed project are aligned to the same version number. So if you are self-hosting an Enclosed instance, you can use the same version number for all the packages.
