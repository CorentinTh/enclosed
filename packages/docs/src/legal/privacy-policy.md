## Introduction

Welcome to Enclosed. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our service.

Enclosed is designed with privacy as a core principle. Our application uses end-to-end encryption, meaning that the content of your notes is encrypted on your device before being sent to our servers, and can only be decrypted by someone with the correct link and password (if set).

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Note Content**: The content of your notes is encrypted on your device before being sent to our servers. We cannot access the unencrypted content of your notes.

- **Authentication Information**: If you choose to create an account, we collect your email address and a hashed version of your password.

- **Usage Data**: We collect information about how you interact with our service, such as access dates and times, pages viewed, and the features you use.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve our service
- Detect, prevent, and address technical issues
- Monitor the usage of our service
- Protect against unauthorized access to our servers

## Data Storage and Security

- **Note Content and Attachments**: These are stored in an encrypted format on our servers and are automatically deleted after the expiration period you set, or after being read (if you selected that option).
- **Authentication Information**: If you create an account, your email and password hash are stored securely.

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
