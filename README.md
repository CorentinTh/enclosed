# Enclosed

**Enclosed** is a minimalistic web application designed for sending private and secure notes.

All notes are end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that the server and storage have zero knowledge of the content. Users can set a password, define an expiration period (TTL), and choose to have the note self-destruct after being read.

A live instance is available at [enclosed.cc](https://enclosed.cc).

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Your notes are encrypted on the client side, and only the intended recipient can decrypt them.
- **Zero Knowledge**: The server does not have access to the content of the notes.
- **Configurable Security Options**: Set a password, expiration time, and choose self-destruction after the note is read.
- **Minimalistic UI**: Simple and intuitive user interface for quick note sharing.

## Self host

### Docker

You can quickly run the application using Docker.

```bash
# From docker hub
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 corentinth/enclosed
# or from GitHub Container Registry
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 ghcr.io/corentin-th/enclosed
```

**With volume persistency**
Replace `/path/to/local/data` with the path to your local data directory.  

```bash
# From docker hub
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -v /path/to/local/data:/app/.data corentinth/enclosed
# or from GitHub Container Registry
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -v /path/to/local/data:/app/.data ghcr.io/corentin-th/enclosed
```

### Docker Compose

You can also use Docker Compose to run the application.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  enclosed:
    image: corentinth/enclosed
    ports:
      - 8787:8787
    volumes:
      - /path/to/local/data:/app/.data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Usage

1. Visit the application URL.
2. Create a new note by entering the content.
3. (Optional) Set a password and expiration time.
4. Save the note, and you will receive a unique link.
5. Share the link with the intended recipient.
